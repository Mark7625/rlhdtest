# Gamevals

The plugin uses gamevals (game values) to map names to IDs for various game entities. These are automatically synced from RuneLite's API and categorized into the following types:

<details>
<summary><b>NPCs</b> - Non-Player Character identifiers</summary>

NPCs (Non-Player Characters) represent all the characters in the game that are controlled by the game itself, such as quest NPCs, shopkeepers, monsters, and other interactive characters. These identifiers are used to reference specific NPCs throughout the plugin.

**Source:** `NpcID.java` from RuneLite

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Objects</b> - Game object identifiers</summary>

Objects represent all interactive items and structures in the game world, such as doors, chests, trees, rocks, furniture, and other environmental elements. These identifiers allow the plugin to recognize and interact with specific game objects.

**Source:** `ObjectID.java` and `ObjectID1.java` from RuneLite

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Animations (Anims)</b> - Animation identifiers</summary>

Animations define the movement and action sequences for NPCs, players, and objects. These identifiers are used to control visual animations, such as walking, attacking, casting spells, and other character or object movements.

**Source:** `AnimationID.java` from RuneLite

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Spot Animations (Spotanims)</b> - Visual effect identifiers</summary>

Spot animations are visual effects that appear in the game, such as spell effects, combat hit effects, item drops, teleport animations, and other temporary graphical effects. These identifiers control when and where these visual effects are displayed.
